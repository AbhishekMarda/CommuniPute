# CommuniPute


## Inspiration
No matter how much you use your computer, it's likely you're not using your computing power to 24/7. That being said, it always feels like when you need power, you can never seem to have enough. Imagine being able to utilize your computer's compute power around the clock. With increasingly powerful machines entering the market (such as Apple's 96 GB RAM M2 MacBook Pro), we're beginning to see an underutilization of these compute resources. On the other hand, we see more and more compute heavy workloads - such as deep learning models - becoming more prevalent. What if there was a way for someone across the world to use your machine's resources while you sleep? Or if you could supercharge your own programs by using the resources of someone that's off their laptop? Noticing this discrepancy, our team decided to address this problem by creating a platform that connects some user's underutilized compute power to other user's compute needs.

## What it does
CommuniPute allows users to make their compute power available to the community and make money off of their computer's utilization. Users who need compute can request this underutilized compute power for their own innovations. A user can request compute power by browsing the catalog of available compute resources and selecting the compute resource of their choice. The script is run on the selected compute platform.
